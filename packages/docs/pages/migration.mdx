# Migration to the new version of @cosmos-kit/react

In the new version, we migrated away from Chakra UI due to numerous runtime errors and the cost of CSS-in-JS. Our new version relies on only `@cosmology-ui/react`, which uses a styling solution that is just pure CSS through a package called
`vanilla-extract`.

To migrate, simply get rid of Chakra UI in your repository and only install `@cosmos-kit/react`. Then follow our `get-started` guide.
