# How to use CosmosKit

> üí° Make sure you are using `React18`
>
> `CosmosKit V1` is deprecated, we suggest use `CosmosKit V2`

## Major Changes in V2

1. `ChakraUI` Removed

In CosmosKit V2, we discard the dependency on `ChakraUI` due to numerous runtime errors and the cost of CSS-in-JS.

Main changes lie on `@cosmos-kit/react`, where the default modal locates. All the modal components are imported from `@cosmology-ui/react`, which is our UI Kit in Cosmology. The latest `@cosmology-ui/react` discards `ChakraUI` and instead adopts a pure CSS styling solution through a package called `vanilla-extract`.

1. Build Process Changed

In CosmosKit V2, we used `tsup` to compile CommonJS, ESM and types. Different from V1 that separate these files in different folders (`main`, `module` and `types`), in V2, they are put in a single folder `dist` and differentiate with different suffix (`.js`, `mjs` and `.d.ts`). In this way non-index sources can easily find its corresponding typings.

## Quickstart

üèÅ Get started quickly by using [create-cosmos-app](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/create-cosmos-app) to help you build high-quality Cosmos apps fast!

## Use CosmosKit from Scratch

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```sh
yarn add @cosmos-kit/react @cosmos-kit/core @cosmos-kit/keplr chain-registry
```

`@cosmos-kit/react` includes default modal made with `@cosmology-ui/react`. If [customized modal](/provider/chain-provider/#customize-modal-with-walletmodal) is providered, you can use `@cosmos-kit/react-lite` instead to lighter your app.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Wrap Provider

First, add [`ChainProvider`](/provider/chain-provider) and provider [required properties](/provider/chain-provider#required-properties).

Example:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';

import { ChainProvider } from '@cosmos-kit/react';
import { chains, assets } from 'chain-registry';
import { wallets } from '@cosmos-kit/keplr';

// Import this in your top-level route/layout
import "@cosmos-kit/react/styles.css";

function CosmosApp() {
  return (
    <ChainProvider
      chains={chains} // supported chains
      assetLists={assets} // supported asset lists
      wallets={wallets} // supported wallets
      walletConnectOptions={...} // required if `wallets` contains mobile wallets
    >
      <YourWalletRelatedComponents />
    </ChainProvider>
  );
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Consume with Hook

Take `useChain` as an example.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';

import { useChain } from "@cosmos-kit/react";

function Component ({ chainName }: { chainName: string }) => {
    const chainContext = useChain(chainName);

    const {
      status,
      username,
      address,
      message,
      connect,
      disconnect,
      openView,
    } = chainContext;
}
```

## Localstorage Settings

### current wallet

- **Key**: `cosmos-kit@1:core//current-wallet`
- **Type**: `string`

It records current wallet name. You can use this key to implement auto-connection in dapp.

### accounts

- **Key**: `cosmos-kit@1:core//accounts`
- **Type**: `SimpleAccount[]`

It records the connected chains' account information. It's used for account restore when refreshing in CosmosKit. And it will expire after provided [session duration](#sessionoptions).
