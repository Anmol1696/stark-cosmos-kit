# How to use CosmosKit

## CosmosKit V2

### Major Changes

1. `ChakraUI` Removed

In CosmosKit V2, we discard the dependency on `ChakraUI` due to numerous runtime errors and the cost of CSS-in-JS.

Main changes lie in `@cosmos-kit/react`, where the default modal locates. All the modal components are imported from `@interchain-ui/react`, which is our UI Kit in Cosmology. The latest `@interchain-ui/react` discards `ChakraUI` and instead adopts a pure CSS styling solution through a package called `vanilla-extract`.

2. Build Process Changed

In CosmosKit V2, we used pure `tsc` to compile CommonJS, ESM (es2022) and types. Different from V1 that separate these files in different folders (`main`, `module` and `types`), in V2, they are put in a single folder `dist` and differentiate with different suffix (`.js`, `mjs` and `.d.ts`). In this way non-index sources can easily find its corresponding typings.

### Migration Guides

1. In CosmosKit V2, we require developers **`import "@interchain-ui/react/styles"`** in your top-level route/layout if you are using our default modal in `@cosmos-kit/react`. i.e. in `_app.tsx` for next project.

2. We don't export `defaultTheme` any more in `@cosmos-kit/react` in CosmosKit V2.

3. `WrappedWithChakra` and `modalTheme` is removed in properties of `ChainProvider` from `@cosmos-kit/react`.

4. `Web3Auth` wallet instance import has been replaced by constructing the wallet instance with a wallet generator function. In this way the web3auth implementation becomes much more secure, and also makes it support any of the login providers. See details [here](/integrating-wallets/web3auth)

## Quickstart

üèÅ Get started quickly by using [create-cosmos-app](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/create-cosmos-app) to help you build high-quality Cosmos apps fast!

## Use CosmosKit from Scratch

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```sh
yarn add @cosmos-kit/react chain-registry
```

`@cosmos-kit/react` includes default modal made with `@interchain-ui/react`. If [customized modal](/provider/chain-provider/#customize-modal-with-walletmodal) is providered, you can use `@cosmos-kit/react-lite` instead to lighter your app.

There are multiple wallets supported by CosmosKit. Details see [Integrating Wallets](/integrating-wallets)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Wrap Provider

First, add [`ChainProvider`](/provider/chain-provider) and provider [required properties](/provider/chain-provider#required-properties).

Example:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';

import { ChainProvider } from '@cosmos-kit/react';
import { chains, assets } from 'chain-registry';
import { wallets } from '@cosmos-kit/keplr';

// Import this in your top-level route/layout
import "@interchain-ui/react/styles";

function CosmosApp() {
  return (
    <ChainProvider
      chains={chains} // supported chains
      assetLists={assets} // supported asset lists
      wallets={wallets} // supported wallets
      walletConnectOptions={...} // required if `wallets` contains mobile wallets
    >
      <YourWalletRelatedComponents />
    </ChainProvider>
  );
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Consume with Hook

Take `useChain` as an example.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';

import { useChain } from "@cosmos-kit/react";

function Component ({ chainName }: { chainName: string }) => {
    const chainContext = useChain(chainName);

    const {
      status,
      username,
      address,
      message,
      connect,
      disconnect,
      openView,
    } = chainContext;
}
```

## Localstorage Settings

### current wallet

- **Key**: `cosmos-kit@2:core//current-wallet`
- **Type**: `string`

It records current wallet name. You can use this key to implement auto-connection in dapp.

### accounts

- **Key**: `cosmos-kit@2:core//accounts`
- **Type**: `SimpleAccount[]`

It records the connected chains' account information. It's used for account restore when refreshing in CosmosKit. And it will expire after provided [session duration](#sessionoptions).
