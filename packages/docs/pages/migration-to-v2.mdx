# Migration from V1 to V2

## Major Changes

1. `ChakraUI` Removed

In CosmosKit V2, we discard the dependency on `ChakraUI` due to numerous runtime errors and the cost of CSS-in-JS.

Main changes lie in `@cosmos-kit/react`, where the default modal locates. All the modal components are imported from `@interchain-ui/react`, which is our UI Kit in Cosmology. The latest `@interchain-ui/react` discards `ChakraUI` and instead adopts a pure CSS styling solution through a package called `vanilla-extract`.

2. Build Process Changed

In CosmosKit V2, we used pure `tsc` to compile CommonJS, ESM (es2022) instead of `babel`. Also, `.js` and `.d.ts` files are no longer to be separated in different folders, in this way non-index sources can easily find its corresponding types.

## Migration Guides

1. In CosmosKit V2, we require developers **`import "@interchain-ui/react/styles"`** in your top-level route/layout if you are using our default modal in `@cosmos-kit/react`. i.e. in [`_app.tsx`](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cosmos-kit/blob/af05600fd1913e0d3eb1bbef05382c1a06c6af69/packages/example/pages/_app.tsx#L4) for next project.

2. We don't export `defaultTheme` any more in `@cosmos-kit/react` in CosmosKit V2.

3. `WrappedWithChakra` and `modalTheme` is removed in properties of `ChainProvider` from `@cosmos-kit/react`.

4. `Web3Auth` wallet instance import has been replaced by constructing the wallet instance with a wallet generator function. In this way the web3auth implementation becomes much more secure, and also makes it support any of the login providers. See details [here](/integrating-wallets/web3auth)
